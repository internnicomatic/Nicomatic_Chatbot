# EMM CONNECTORS

For pre-wired or to crimp contacts, EMM connectors offer racking or locked fixing hardware for cabling. With or without backpotting, these connectors can be crimped or pre-cabled, ranging from AWG24 to AWG30. Whatever your expectation, EMM connectors will meet your need. Backpotting is recommended for enhanced protection.

Contacts A and B are the same ones. The differentiation in the codification comes from the addition of a ring in peek to crimp the AWG 24.
