# Action points from the previous meeting

> Shorter prompt
> Trying out different embedding models
> Better stratergy for segmentation of data
> Guard rails

# Experimentation based above inputs completed till now

1. Tried out varients of the prompt inorder to make it smaller and more precise. An efficient prompt with optimal results was indeed given.
2. Experimented with differenet embeddings models for faster retireval.
3. Tried out different chunking stratergy and in the process of learning and implementing knowledge graph.
