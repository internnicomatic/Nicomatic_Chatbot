      "Final Answer: Based on our previous conversation, you mentioned needing a right-angle connector for PCB mounting with AWG26 contacts. You also discussed the requirements for signal and power contacts, non-isolated power, high vibration, 80 contacts, and no panel mounting. However, we were unable to gather more specific information about your application and environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors, I would recommend exploring the Nicomatic's EMM connector family as a potential solution. The EMM connectors are known for their high-density configuration, which could accommodate the 80 contact requirement. Additionally, they often feature right-angle PCB mounting options, which aligns with your initial request.\n",

      "However, please note that without more specific information about your application and environment, this recommendation is based on educated guesses rather than precise matches.\n",
