# These contain all the additional experimentation we carried out

1. CrewAI.ipynb: Experimentation with crewAI to define and use agent orchaestration
2. langgraph.ipynb: Experimentation with lang graph to incorporate stateful workflow with hallucination graders to avoid hallucination and better responses
3. teach.py: Which incorporates Mem0 layer for teaching the LLM model based on longterm memory (has longterm memory in the form of embeddings). This also incorporates automatic updation of memory.
4. sql_memory.py: Experimentation with longterm memory where the memory is stored in sql database. the memory can be updated and added and infered with function calls.
