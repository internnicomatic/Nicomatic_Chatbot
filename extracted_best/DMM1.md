# DMM CONNECTORS - INTRODUCTION

Assembly

DMM connectors combine a major and unique know-how in the assembly process. An epoxy resin is dispensed between the insulator and shell by a fully automated, three-axis machine. After polymerization, the epoxy becomes solid and acts as a mechanical key, resulting in insert retention five times higher than the MIL-DTL-83513G requirements.

TIPS

Nicomatic has automated the assembly of shell and insulator. If you need a custom shape, want to add a personal engraving, change your contacts layout, or adjust the pitch, contact us for assistance as part of our in-house services!

# 32 I DMM CONNECTORS I INTRODUCTION

EMI Effective shielding Electromagnetic interference concerns Nicomatic Know-how

The increasing amount of data in electronic systems can have a disastrous result if the impact of cross talk is not anticipated.

tools are available on our website. Openings allow wires to be fastened with a band clamp system and also to ground the shielding of the twisted pair cable. There are 2 backshell designs available, split and mono.

In the event of electromagnetic interference (EMI, RFI or EMP), the cable’s conductor acts like an antenna and picks up the radiated signals. The reception of this interference will inevitably affect the integrity of the initial signal. Today, data rate is increasing exponentially and high-speed protocols are omnipresent.

A proper shielding features as a key part of the design.

The backshell as a rear part of the NICOMATIC DMM MIL-DTL-83513G connector is used to secure the cable and to avoid stresses to the soldered/crimped part of the contact. It also shields against electrical interference (EMI/ RFI protection) with Transfer Impedance (Zt) under 200mOhm from 10 KHz to 400Mhz compliant with MIL-STD-1377 (screened cable/connector method). Made of Aluminium 6061 with chemical nickel finish, it protects from mechanical damages.

The back chimneys are designed in an ellipse shape that is fully compatible with common banding systems. Bands and clamping hand

The split backshell is fully compatible with all Nicomatic DMM connectors, and designed as a two-piece shell. The fixing hardware is mounted on the connector and the locking of the two parts of the shell does not interfere with the harness which is made independently in a previous stage. This means that the hardware is quick and easy to assemble.

The mono backshell is fully compatible with all Nicomatic DMM connectors. Given that it is lighter and smaller, it is a smart and cost-effective solution for the series stage.

The flange has a strong impact on EMI performance in case of panel mounting. As it fills the space between the panel cut and the connector, it greatly improves attenuation (up to 15dB). The chart on the next page represents the attenuation according to the IEEE-STD-299-1997 (Standard Method for Measuring the Effectiveness of Electromagnetic Shielding Enclosures).

In the same way, EMI O-Ring DMM, as an evolution of the DMM flange, provides advanced performance for extreme requirements. For more information, please consult our "Exclusive DMM pages". (P.76)

INTRODUCTION

Alternative solution

Today, Nicomatic can offer you the best of the innovation on micro-modular connector market. A metalized composite MicroD connector: The DLMM.

We all know that every ounce in weight reduces the lead time up to 3 weeks. Indeed, metalization acts as a strong body armor to protect the DLMM.

The DLMM weights 20% less than the DMM and 40% less than a Backshell. How to achieve such high performance? We use an ULTEM composite shell, which also helps to reduce the cost of manufacturing and is less expensive than a standard MicroD connector and qualified in compliance with MIL-DTL-83513G and tested under radio frequency interferences. Thanks to its copper under-layer, it guarantees high EMI protection, identical to our standard DMM.

# With Elodie

Screw-machining specialist

Without doubt, contacts & fixings are some of the most crucial parts of a connector. We met with Elodie, one of our young screw-machining specialists.

# Inside Nicomatic

As an expert in Mechanics and Mathematics, a screw machinist is a specialist who can make various kinds of miniature pieces used in different sectors characterised by harsh environments: Aeronautics, automotive, electronics, optical, medical etc.

This profession requires a high degree of precision and good work methods. Screw machinists make real elements and products from drawings. They turn the ideas of the engineers into reality. It’s impressive to see how they transform raw materials into real products: From a steel bar to a connector fixing for example.

People to learn this profession.

"I arrived few years ago as a young operator on combined work-study contract. I learned among passionate people who shared their experience and skills with me every day. However, given that I had just finished my studies in microtechnology and my team members had at least 10 years of experience in this domain, it was very difficult at the beginning. I had to work hard to establish myself and gain recognition in the male-dominated world of screw machining and even from my team. In my team, I think we are all equal, we wear the same shirt, we work on the same machines and we can count on each other."

Like engineers who develop users’ environments to offer the most suitable solution, machining operators need to take into account all external environments in order to produce the perfect parts.

This kind of precision has always interested Elodie, our young machining operator: “My dream is to become screw machining expert and easily produce all kind of miniature parts and help other leading experts!"

"I’m very confident for my future. I would like to continue developing among the best specialists to help other new arrivals like myself a few years ago, to teach them my know-how and tips for screw machining."

Elodie F.

"Learn among leading experts!"

# DMM CONNECTORS - MANUFACTURING

With Priscilla, Machining manager. A plant is a never-ending procession, livened up by the coming and going of people and activities. To manage this continual flow and maintain a very high level of quality and performance, we need different talents and strong personalities. Let’s meet Priscilla, manager of the screw machining department.

Inside Nicomatic, Technology studies were an obvious choice for me. Since I was a kid, I have always loved complex devices and electronics and handling them. Today I have lost count of how many alarm clocks, radios and other electronic devices that I have taken apart and assembled again, not always successfully. It drove my parents crazy! Technology was and still is my passion! That’s why I chose my studies curriculum/orientation in industrial design of electronics and micro-technology. First I discovered a magic world of extraordinary machines and high tech. I was particularly interested in high tech and innovation.

This is good news for me, given that we produce the following fabulous products in the machining department: miniaturised elements that are the fruit of hours of work and thinking beforehand, involving the entire team. The teamwork and human relations is the second passion I discovered during my studies. Being naturally curious and because I needed a summer job, I obtained a summer camp activity leader certification (BAFA/BAFD). This gave me the basic elements I needed for project and team management and the desire to associate both management and technology in my professional life. That’s why I chose to do a master’s degree in Industry management. As a woman, it is often difficult to find our place in the male-dominated world of industry. We have to prove our expertise and work 3 times harder at it. However, even if there are not many women in this profession, they show that the passion for the work is not related to gender! It proves that if we like our job and want to use our expertise in the industrial sector, we can do it. Because the world is changing and people’s visions are, too. Here, at Nicomatic, the general mindset had changed even before my arrival. Today I’m proud to be a woman and a young manager, that I was trusted to manage 3 mini-plants on Nicomatic’s production line.

For me, being a manager means being demanding with myself before being demanding with others. Details are very important as we are producing elements for very challenging and secure environments. We have to keep an eye on everything to avoid any errors. However being a manager is also about coaching our teams. We should be present when people need us and help them achieve their personal aspirations. As success cannot be achieved without a team and talented people.

If I would like my team to give the best of themselves, I should be exemplary in their eyes, live with them, be close to them, listen to their needs, understand their problems and make their lives easier. For me the human aspect is a key part of the success of our organization.

1 In case of a thicker PCB, we can easily manufacture a longer fixings.

2 If one connector is mounted with a jackpost fixing, its mating must be mounted with a jackscrew fixing.

3 If one connector is mounted with guide socket fixing, its mating must be mounted with guide pin.

4 Fixings are delivered mounted on the connector.
